    "# Text Splitters\n",

    "When working with large documents we will usually need to split them into smaller, more manageable chunks.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This is especially important in the context of in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  \n",
    "RAG involves fetching relevant pieces of information from a large dataset and using them to generate accurate and context-aware responses. Without properly split text, the retrieval process can become inefficient, potentially missing critical pieces of information or returning irrelevant data. By using text splitters to create well-defined chunks, the retrieval process can be streamlined, ensuring that the most relevant information is easily accessible. This not only enhances the efficiency of data retrieval but also improves the quality and relevance of the generated responses, making text splitters an important tool in the RAG workflow.\n",

    "## Key parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- separator: Define the characters that will be used for splitting the text.\n",
    "- chunk_size: Specify the maximum size of your chunks to ensure they are as granular or broad as needed.\n",
    "- chunk_overlap: Maintain context between chunks by setting the chunk_overlap parameter, which determines the number of characters that overlap between consecutive chunks. This helps ensure that information isn't lost at the chunk boundaries.\n",
    "- length_function: Define how the length of chunks is calculated."
