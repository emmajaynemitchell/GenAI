    "Loading different file types including text, PDF, Markdown, JSON, CSV, and Doc X, directly from websites and handle unstructured files.\n",
    "LangChain uses document loaders to gather information from several sources such as websites, files, and databases, and then prepares it for further use. Document loaders, act as connectors, pulling in data, and converting it into a format LangChain can work with.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Loading documents from different sources\n",
    "- plain text files, you can utilize the text loader class and LangChain to load them efficiently. LangChain features a load method explicitly designed for loading data as documents from configured sources.\n",
    "- PDF files, the PyPDFLoader class in LangChain is your go-to tool. can also use the PyMuPDFLoader, the fastest PDF parsing tool in LangChain. The critical difference between PyMuPDFLoader and PyPDFLoader is that it includes more comprehensive metadata. - problems with loading pdf: preserving structure, images, tables etc.\n",
    "- Markdown files - LangChain offers unstructured markdown loader class to load it\n",
    "- JSON - JSON loader class specifically designed to load JSON files. This loader utilizes a JQ schema to parse JSON files according to specific needs\n",
    "- CSV - CSV loader and LangChain is the ideal tool. This loader is designed to handle CSV files by converting each row of data into a separate document object. Here's an example. If you want to load the data, all in one document object, you can use unstructured CSV loader. This is useful when analyzing the data as a table rather than individual entries\n",
    "- Online webpage - BeautifulSoup or WebBaseLoader and LangChain is designed to efficiently extract all text from HTML web pages and convert it into a document format suitable for downstream processing, the loader only captures all text from the web page, avoiding HTML tags and links, \n",
    "- For projects requiring flexibility due to unknown or varied file formats, the unstructured file loader in LangChain works perfectly. This loader is designed for general-purpose use and supports many file types, including text files, PowerPoint presentations, HTML pages, PDFs, images, and more\n",
